abstract
 PyMod 3 is a PyMOL plugin, designed to act as simple and intuitive interface between PyMOL and several
bioinformatics tools (i.e., PSI-BLAST, Clustal Omega, HMMER, MUSCLE, CAMPO, PSIPRED, and MODELLER).
The current PyMod release, PyMod 3, has been extended with a rich set of functionalities that 
substantially improve it over its predecessor (PyMod 2.0), particularly in its ability to build homology models through
the popular MODELLER package.Starting from the amino acid sequence of a target protein, users may take advantage of PyMod 3 
to carry out the three steps of the homology modeling process (that is, template searching, target-template sequence alignment
and model building) in order to build a 3D atomic model of a target protein (or protein complex). Additionally, PyMod 3 may also
be used outside the homology modeling context, in order to extend PyMOL with numerous types of functionalities. Sequence similarity 
searches, multiple sequence-structure alignments and evolutionary/phylogeny analyses can all be performed in the PyMod 3/PyMOL
environment.
